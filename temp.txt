All DDL scripts will modeled through ERWIN.
Development will occur in a shared development database (DEV01/DEV02)
Once the final version of a script has been generated from Erwin and tested in the development database, the process of getting the change into Github and SYST will likely to deployed manually and SIT,UAT and PROD will follow the below steps:
a feature/  branch will be created off from develop  branch
the script(s) are added to the feature branch
tests will performed on DEV and SYST databases.
a Pull Request is initiated to merge the feature branch into the develop  branch after successful completion of tests.
a release/xxxxx branch will be created off from develop  branch for planned releases.
a release script/s will be prepared and added to the release branch (in the Release folder for every individual schema)
a 'Release Implementer' needs to manually run the Jenkins pipeline to deploy the release scripts to SIT,UAT and PROD (with the respective pipeline executing the release script from release branch)
once the deployment successful, then a PR# is initiated to merge release branch into the develop branch.
